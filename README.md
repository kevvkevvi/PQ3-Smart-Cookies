# PQ3-Smart-Cookies
Jack Beckitt-Marshall, Yvonne Fang, Kevin Li – Bowdoin College – CSCI 3725

This project uses cookie recipes on the internet to generate a selection of new, unique recipes based off of the popularity and the compatibility of its ingredients. We then created a food2vec fitness function that uses Markov Chains to determine the fittest of the offspring to produce the next generation. We get our final cookie recipe by doing 50 iterations and getting the offspring with the highest fitness level.
